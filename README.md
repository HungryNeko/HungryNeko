# Featured Projects
- Notice:  Some projects are still in private repository.
- **GBC: Gaussian-Based Colorization and Super-Resolution for 3D Reconstruction** :
  - GBC is an AI framework that transforms low-quality B&W videos into high-resolution color 3D models using optical flow super-resolution, temporal colorization, and 3D Gaussian splatting, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity for historical footage restoration.
  - Accepted by ACM SIGGRAPH VRCAI ’24.

- **Safety-driven Path Selection Using Reinforcement-Learning in Autonomous Driving**:
  - Safety-driven autonomous path selection using P2P reports and RL to validate road data, exclude unreliable sources, and optimize safe routes via K-shortest paths.  
  - Accepted by RSAE 2025, wait to publish

- **BMS^3: Bayesian Modeling Based SwinUNet Segmentation on Self-distillation Architecture**:
  - BMS³ introduces a Bayesian SwinUNet with self-distillation for domain-invariant medical image segmentation, outperforming ResNet/TransUNet in cross-domain generalization and computational efficiency. Code available upon publication.
  - Accepted by ICONIP 2025.
