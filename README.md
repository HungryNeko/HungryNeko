- **GBC: Gaussian-Based Colorization and Super-Resolution for 3D Reconstruction** :
  - GBC is an AI framework that transforms low-quality B&W videos into high-resolution color 3D models using optical flow super-resolution, temporal colorization, and 3D Gaussian splatting, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity for historical footage restoration.

- **Safety-driven Path Selection Using Reinforcement-Learning in Autonomous Driving**:
  - Safety-driven autonomous path selection using P2P reports and RL to validate road data, exclude unreliable sources, and optimize safe routes via K-shortest paths.  
  - Accepted by RSAE 2025, wait to publish

- **BMS^3: Bayesian Modeling Based SwinUNet Segmentation on Self-distillation Architecture**:
  - BMS³ introduces a Bayesian SwinUNet with self-distillation for domain-invariant medical image segmentation, outperforming ResNet/TransUNet in cross-domain generalization and computational efficiency. Code available upon publication.

- **SAR data training with YOLOv8**:
  - Trained by YOLOv8, SAR images with object detection(with and without OBB), image classification, image preprocession, txt file to XML, data argumentation, create new image data through means such as flipping, cropping and pasting.
